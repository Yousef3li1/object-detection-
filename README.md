# 🖼️ Object Detection using YOLOv5

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **real-time object detection** using **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once Version 5)**, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for fast and accurate object detection. The notebook includes steps for **model loading, image processing, object detection, and result visualization**. The project supports **real-time detection from images, webcam feeds, and custom datasets**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Uses YOLOv5 for high-speed, accurate object detection**  
✅ **Supports real-time detection from webcam feeds**  
✅ **Processes and detects objects in images with bounding boxes**  
✅ **Switches between different YOLOv5 models (`yolov5s`, `yolov5m`, `yolov5l`, `yolov5x`)**  
✅ **Displays class labels and confidence scores**  
✅ **Can be extended to train on custom datasets**
